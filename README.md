Close monitor but keep Windows running on "Instant Go" laptop devices!

You might got a laptop device whatever what it is. And you found that when you close the monitor(or Win+L lock screen), entire system almost sleep immediatly...

And your torrent client not work, too. Desktop applications not work but Windows Store Apps is fine, but useless for you.

You still want close monitor to reduce battery usage. And you want the thing close monitor and keep working for your long time task.

This script use void display to keep Windows running but output nothing video signal so hardware will think you still using it.

And change some powerplan to prevent auto sleep, this is OK.

When you wan't re-open the monitor, press Win+P twice, or more time until it actually switch back.
